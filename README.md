## How to make a commit

 To make a commit must be used a following rule:

 `git commit -m "*type*: commit-message"`

- Where type is: [`build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`]

- And commit-message must be written in lower-case.

## How to contribute

- Fetch/pull the Develop Branch
- Create a Branch based on your issue name
- e.g - Branch name is task/mcw-(number)
- e.g - Branch name is bug/mcw-(number)
- Once done push your branch to origin and submit a PR to the Develop branch for review ðŸ˜˜

## Decisions

For the development of the entire project, I used the SWOT analysis, in choosing the technologies to be used, I analyzed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the choice of each decision.

## Code maintenance and quality

To optimize maintenance and ensure code quality, considering a large or even small company, I would apply some routines,such as:

- Avoid duplicate code
- Tests: Developing routines that test the validations necessary to perform some purpose helps a lot in understanding the code. Which also serves as documentation
- Clearly name the functions, methods and variables
- Improve performance: In maintenance, it is much easier to change in one place and solve the problem than to change in several other places and still have the possibility of forgetting some place.
